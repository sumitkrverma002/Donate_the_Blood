Title: Enhancing Blood Transfusion Safety Through the Use of Online Blood Bank 
Management System.
Abstract   
Blood transfusion safety is a relevant and significant public health issue in the Sultanate 
of Oman. Since most blood banks are still in paper-based system, various disadvantages are 
experienced by various stakeholders, which endanger the lives of patients and deter the 
healthcare system. As such, the researchers aimed to design, develop, and implement an online 
blood bank management system (OBBMS). This web-based application allows hospitals in 
Oman to make inventories of their blood bags online, subsequently, allowing each hospital to 
check the availability of blood bags anytime. The researchers designed and administered a 
questionnaire that assess the perceptions of various stakeholders in both manual-based and 
OBBMS. Based on the findings and results, it was found out that these stakeholders perceived 
online blood bank management system is much better than the manual system. Therefore, with 
the use of online blood bank management system, blood transfusion process is safe and secured. 
Threats on improper blood donor documentation, or misplaced records will be totally 
eradicated. Also, processes involving recording about blood donors, blood bag collection, 
storage, and inventory will be systematized and organized, hence, improving the healthcare 
management for blood banks.
